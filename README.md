Short chess engineproject I'm working on.

How to Use Chess Engine:  

1.) Run the program in a Python environment or using a Python IDE.  

2.) You will be prompted to select a difficulty, there is hard or easy, the only difference is the depth of their search. Bear in mind that the Hard engine may take about a minute to compute an answer in the early game 

3.) Upon selecting a difficulty, you will be thrown into the game (playing as white) and asked to input your starting move.  

4.) The engine will then respond with its own move and spit out the move to the terminal. 

5.) The notation for the move given by the computer will be two spaces on the board, the first representing the piece it wants to move and the second representing where to move the piece to. Ex. g8h6 would be the same as just h6 or saying “take the pawn on g8 and move it to h6”
